# AuthorIdentification
Authorship attribution is an important task, as it identifies the author of a written text from a set of suspect authors. Differentmethodologies of anonymous writing, have been discovered with the rising usage of social media. This anonymous writing leads to anincrease in malicious and suspicious activities, and anonymity makes it difficult to find the suspect. Authorship attribution helps to findthe writer of a suspect text from a set of suspects. Different social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. are usedregularly by the users for sharing their daily life activities. Finding the writer of micro-texts is considered the toughest task, due to theshorter length of the suspect piece of text. We present a Capsule based Convolutional Neural Network model over character n-grams for performing the authorship attribution task. Capsule with Kervolutional Neural Networks (KNNs) has also been utilized for this task.We also present different analyses of our developed system, which improves the interpretability of our developed system. Heat-mapsfor different models, illustrate the relevant text fragments for the prediction task. A standard Twitter dataset is used for evaluating theperformance of the developed systems. The experimental evaluation shows that capsule-based CNNs and capsule-based KNNsperform competitively and are able to outperform previous methods. The source codes will be publicly available after acceptance of this work.
